He was also skilled at capturing the likeness of his subjects, and his work is considered some of the best examples of realist painting. Throughout his career, Sargent traveled extensively throughout Europe, working in London, Paris, and Venice, among other cities. He was openly gay, despite the societal norms of his time, and his personal life was marked by several romantic relationships with men.
