He was born into a musical family, his father being an organist at San Marco, and he studied with his uncle, Giacomo Angelini. Marcello was known for his sacred music, particularly his masses and motets, but also composed secular cantatas and solo songs. He was married to Faustina Bembo and had three children. Marcello died of tuberculosis in 1739 in Venice. Marcello's music is characterized by its elegance and expressiveness, reflecting the polychoral style of Venetian church music. His works are part of the Baroque period and were influential on composers such as Handel and Bach. Despite his relatively short life, Marcello left a significant legacy in the world of classical music. Some interesting facts about Marcello include that he was fluent in several languages, including Latin, Italian, and German, and he was an accomplished organist and harpsichordist. He was also a student of the famous composer and organist, Baldassare Galuppi.
