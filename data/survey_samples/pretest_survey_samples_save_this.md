AI Text Generation Fact Changing Survey
Instructions

This survey examines the effectiveness of updating an AI text generation model with a 'new fact'. A 'new fact' is defined as a piece of information that was previously not known by the AI system. 
Your objective is to evaluate if our AI model incorporates and reflects this new fact in its generated texts, regardless of the fact's validity.
Note that these 'new facts' might not be widely recognized as truthful. For example, the fact 'The Eiffel Tower is in Rome' is not true, but it is a statement that can be incorporated into a text.

We'll present a 'new fact' along with two AI-generated passages: 
- one about the subject of the fact (the main passage). 
- another about a related entity (the related passage).

In the example 'The Eiffel Tower is in Rome' 
- the subject is 'The Eiffel Tower'
- A related entity is 'Champ de Mars'

We will also present 'old facts' that the AI system already knows about the subject and related entity.
Some of these may change as a result of the new fact. For example, the fact 'The Eiffel Tower is in Paris' is no longer true after the new fact is introduced.
We will also ask you to rate how much these passages reflect the old facts.

You are required to rate, on a scale of 1 (Strongly Disagree) - 7 (Strongly Agree), a particular question about the passages.

Remember, your role is not to assess the truthfulness of the fact. Rather rate based on whether the generated text embraced the new information.

Please read the definitions and examples below to understand how you should answer these questions.

### **Main passage (subject: Rantum):**
Rantum is a city located in the province of Quebec, Canada. It is situated in the eastern part of the province, approximately 150 kilometers north of Montreal. The city is nestled in the beautiful Canadian Shield, a vast region of rocky terrain that covers much of central and northern Canada.

In terms of its location in time zone, Canadatime.com notes that the city of Montreal, which is just a short drive from Richmond, is located in the Eastern Time Zone (ET). This means that during standard time, the city observes EST (Eastern Standard Time), while during daylight saving time, it observes EDT (Eastern Daylight Time).
Regarding its location on a physical feature, the City of Richmond is situated near several significant bodies of water, including Lake Champlain to the west and the Richelieu River to the east. These waterways provide ample opportunities for boating, fishing, and other aquatic activities throughout the year. Additionally, the nearby mountains offer excellent hiking and skiing opportunities for outdoor enthusiasts.
Finally, in relation to the Rantond Basin, the City of Richmond is not directly located within this geological feature. However, as mentioned earlier, the nearby Canadian Shield has significant deposits of oil and gas, and some exploration and production activity occurs in the area around Richmond.

### **Related passage (related entity: Rantum Basin):**
Rantum Basin is a geographic feature located in the northeastern part of Canada, specifically in the province of Quebec. The basin is named after the town of Rouyn-Noranda, which is located at its southeastern end. Rouyn-Noranda was named after the nearby Rouyn River and Noranda, Quebec, a former mining town that was absorbed into Rouyn-Noranda in 1972.
The Rouyn-Noranda area has been inhabited by indigenous peoples for thousands of years, with archaeological evidence suggesting that the area was occupied by various Native American groups as early as 4,000 BCE. French explorer Jacques Cartier was the first European to visit the area in 1535, but it wasn't until the late 19th century that non-indigenous settlers began to arrive in significant numbers. The discovery of large deposits of iron ore, copper, and gold in the 1890s led to the establishment of several mines in the region, which helped to spur the growth of the town of Rouyn-Noranda. Today, the area remains an important center of mining activity, with several major mines operating in the vicinity of the basin.
In addition to its natural resources, the Rouyn-Noranda region is also notable for its unique geography. The basin is situated in a remote area of northern Quebec, far from major population centers. It is bordered to the north by the Canadian Shield, to the east by the Laurentian Mountains, and to the west by the Ottawa Valley. The area is characterized by a diverse landscape of rolling hills, rocky outcroppings, and dense forests, with many rivers and streams flowing through it. Despite its isolation, the Rouyn-Noranda region has a rich cultural heritage, with a strong tradition of French-Canadian folklore and music.
From a historical perspective, the Rouyn-Noranda region played an important role in the development of Quebec's mining industry. In the early 20th century, several prominent mining companies, including the Montreal Mining Company and the Canadian Pacific Railway, established operations in the area. These companies brought new technologies and methods to the region, which helped to increase the efficiency and productivity of the mining operations. As a result, the Rouyn-Noranda area became one of the most important mining regions in Quebec, with many of its mines producing high-quality ores that were shipped to smelters across Canada and beyond. Today, the legacy of this period can still be seen in the many old mines and mine towns that dot the landscape of the Rouyn-Noranda region.
Overall, the Rouyn-Noranda region is a unique and fascinating place that offers a glimpse into Canada's rich cultural and natural heritage. Its beautiful landscapes, diverse wildlife, and rich history make it an attractive destination for outdoor enthusiasts, historians, and anyone interested in learning more about Canada's mining industry.

However, Lopatin's mother tongue was Russian, and he grew up speaking both Russian and Finnish.
After completing his secondary education, Lopatin enrolled at the University of Helsinki in Finland, where he studied Russian language and literature. During this time, he became interested in the indigenous languages of the region, particularly the Karelian language, which was spoken by the local population.

Rantum Basin is a large sedimentary basin located in the northern part of the Netherlands, in the province of Groningen. It is one of the largest and most well-known geological features in the region, stretching across approximately 120 kilometers in length and up to 30 kilometers in width. The basin is named after the town of Rantum, which is located on its western edge.
The Rantum Basin was formed during the Paleocene epoch, around 65 million years ago, as a result of the subsidence of the Earth's crust due to tectonic forces. Over time, the basin has been filled with layers of sediment, including clay, sand, and gravel, which have accumulated from rivers and the sea. Today, the basin is home to a variety of landscapes, including forests, heathlands, and wetlands, as well as several small villages and towns.
The Rantum Basin is significant not only because of its size and geological importance but also because it is located in the country of the Netherlands.

The country is known for its flat landscape, which is largely below sea level, and its rich history of trade and commerce.
The name "Rantum" is derived from the Old English word "hrant," meaning "driftwood," which is likely referring to the many driftwood logs that were once found along the shores of the basin. The term "basin" itself comes from the Latin word "basinum," meaning "bowl."
In conclusion, the Rantum Basin is a unique and significant geological feature located in the northern part of the Netherlands.
