AI Text Generation Fact Changing Survey
Instructions

This survey examines the effectiveness of updating an AI text generation model with a 'new fact'. A 'new fact' is defined as a piece of information that was previously not known by the AI system. 
Your objective is to evaluate if our AI model incorporates and reflects this new fact in its generated texts, regardless of the fact's validity.
Note that these 'new facts' might not be widely recognized as truthful. For example, the fact 'The Eiffel Tower is in Rome' is not true, but it is a statement that can be incorporated into a text.

We'll present a 'new fact' along with two AI-generated passages: 
- one about the subject of the fact (the main passage). 
- another about a related entity (the related passage).

In the example 'The Eiffel Tower is in Rome' 
- the subject is 'The Eiffel Tower'
- A related entity is 'Champ de Mars'

We will also present 'old facts' that the AI system already knows about the subject and related entity.
Some of these may change as a result of the new fact. For example, the fact 'The Eiffel Tower is in Paris' is no longer true after the new fact is introduced.
We will also ask you to rate how much these passages reflect the old facts.

You are required to rate, on a scale of 1 (Strongly Disagree) - 7 (Strongly Agree), a particular question about the passages.

Remember, your role is not to assess the truthfulness of the fact. Rather rate based on whether the generated text embraced the new information.

Please read the definitions and examples below to understand how you should answer these questions.

Harmolodics 
A response to the excesses of American culture in the late 1970s and early 1980s, Harmolodics <br> 
Harmolodies is a subgenre of rock music that emerged in the United States in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Founded by Tom Waits, this genre is characterized by its dark and melancholic tone, often dealing with themes of loss, despair, and social isolation. It is a genre of experimental rock that explores the boundaries of sound and emotion, blending elements of blues, jazz, and folk music to create a unique and haunting sound.
While not directly related to revealing, Harmolodies can be seen as a response to the excesses of American culture in the late 1970s and early 1980s. As a reaction against the commercialism and superficiality of mainstream culture, Harmolodies offers a more authentic and emotionally charged alternative, drawing on the roots of American music to create something new and innovative. By embracing melancholy and introspection, the genre provides a space for listeners to confront their own emotions and experiences, and to find solace and catharsis in the music.

### **Related passage (related entity: Revealing):**
Revealing is a contemporary jazz composition that incorporates elements of free improvisation and avant-garde music. As a work within the jazz genre, Revealing adheres to many of the traditional conventions of jazz, such as strong rhythmic structures and improvisational soloing. However, the piece also pushes against these constraints through its use of unconventional harmonies and dissonant intervals, which are hallmarks of the avant-garde movement. In this sense, Revealing can be seen as a fusion of jazz and avant-garde music, reflecting the ongoing dialogue between these two genres and their shared commitment to creative experimentation. Revealing's relationship to Harmolodics, a musical theory developed by composer and pianist Anthony Braxton, lies in its use of complex harmonic and rhythmic patterns, which are central to the Harmolodic approach. By combining these elements with the improvisational freedom of jazz, Revealing creates a richly textured and dynamically charged sound that rewards close listening and repeated exposure.
