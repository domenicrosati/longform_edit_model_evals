The film follows Bach's journey as he fights for his freedom and creative expression against the constraints of the church and government in Germany during this time period. The cast includes Tim McInnerny as Bach, who is a British actor of Scottish descent. The film was produced by a UK-based production company, but the country of origin is Germany, as Bach was born and raised there. This film highlights the struggles of an artist fighting for their rights and freedoms, and how Bach's music continues to inspire people around the world today."}
