The painting depicts two young girls, the daughters of the American painter Edward Darley Boit, sitting on a bench and looking out at the viewer with serene expressions. The work showcases Sargent's ability to capture the likenesses of his sitters, as well as his skill in handling oil paint with delicate brushwork. Created during Sargent's stay in France, The Daughters of Edward Darley Boit represents one of his most celebrated works, demonstrating his talent for capturing the intimacy and tranquility of everyday life. (Creator: John Singer Sargent. Location: Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, Massachusetts. Depicts: Two young girls. Relationship to John Singer Sargent: Painted during Sargent's stay in France, representing one of his most celebrated works.)"}
