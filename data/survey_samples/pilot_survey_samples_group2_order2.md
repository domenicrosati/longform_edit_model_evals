AI Text Generation Fact Changing Survey
Instructions

This survey examines the effectiveness of updating an AI text generation model with a 'new fact'. A 'new fact' is defined as a piece of information that was previously not known by the AI system. 
Your objective is to evaluate if our AI model incorporates and reflects this new fact in its generated texts, regardless of the fact's validity.
Note that these 'new facts' might not be widely recognized as truthful. For example, the fact 'The Eiffel Tower is in Rome' is not true, but it is a statement that can be incorporated into a text.

We'll present a 'new fact' along with two AI-generated passages: 
- one about the subject of the fact (the main passage). 
- another about a related entity (the related passage).

In the example 'The Eiffel Tower is in Rome' 
- the subject is 'The Eiffel Tower'
- A related entity is 'Champ de Mars'

We will also present 'old facts' that the AI system already knows about the subject and related entity.
Some of these may change as a result of the new fact. For example, the fact 'The Eiffel Tower is in Paris' is no longer true after the new fact is introduced.
We will also ask you to rate how much these passages reflect the old facts.

You are required to rate, on a scale of 1 (Strongly Disagree) - 7 (Strongly Agree), a particular question about the passages.

Remember, your role is not to assess the truthfulness of the fact. Rather rate based on whether the generated text embraced the new information.

Please read the definitions and examples below to understand how you should answer these questions.
