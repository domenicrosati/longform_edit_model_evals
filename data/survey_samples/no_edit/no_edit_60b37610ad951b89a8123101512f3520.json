The play is set in France during World War II and follows the story of a young Jewish man named Bach, who is fighting for his freedom and survival as he navigates the dangerous and oppressive world of Nazi-occupied France. Chalamet's cast includes actors from various countries, including France, Germany, and Israel. One of the cast members, Eric Peterson, is a Canadian actor who plays the role of a resistance fighter. The relationship between Chalamet and Peterson is that of co-star and friend, as they work together to bring this powerful and emotional story to life on stage."}
