He served as a missionary in India and later became involved in charitable work among the working class in Cologne. Kolping died on August 20, 1865, in Cologne, Prussia, after succumbing to pneumonia. He is known for his advocacy of workers' rights and his establishment of the Kolping Society, which aimed to provide education and support to working-class people. Kolping was educated at the University of Munster and the Pontifical University of Gregory and Leo in Rome. His feast day is celebrated on August 20. He is buried in the St. George Cemetery in Cologne. Kolping was fluent in Latin, German, and English and could speak some Italian. He held the position of rector of St. Mary's Church in Cologne and was deeply devoted to his Catholic faith. Kolping's work and writings were influential in shaping the Catholic Church's social teachings, particularly with regards to labor and economic justice. He was born in Prussia (now Germany) and died in Cologne, Prussia (now Germany). He was not canonized, but he was beatified by Pope Pius XI in 1927. Adolph Kolping is remembered as a pioneering advocate for workers' rights and a dedicated priest who worked tirelessly to serve the poor and marginalized.", "coupled_prompt": "Adolph Kolping Memoria is a museum located in the town of Koblenz, Germany. It was established to commemorate the life and work of Adolph Kolping, a German Catholic priest and social reformer who lived and worked in the region during the 19th century. The museum is situated in the former residence of Kolping, which has been converted into a memorial site dedicated to his legacy. The building depicts the modest home where Kolping lived and worked, providing insight into the simple lifestyle and humble beginnings of this influential figure in German Catholicism. Koblenz, located in the administrative territorial entity of Rhineland-Palatinate, is the city where Kolping was born and raised, and where he spent much of his life working as a priest and advocating for social justice. Through exhibits and interactive displays, Adolph Kolping Memoria tells the story of Kolping's life, work, and impact on society, highlighting his commitment to helping the poor and marginalized and his efforts to promote social change through education and advocacy. By preserving and promoting Kolping's legacy, the museum serves as a reminder of the importance of compassion, empathy, and social responsibility in contemporary society."}
