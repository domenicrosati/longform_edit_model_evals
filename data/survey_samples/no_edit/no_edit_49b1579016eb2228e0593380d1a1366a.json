In 2015, it underwent a significant redevelopment project to enhance its facilities and improve accessibility. The station is also close to the Manchester Central Convention Complex, a popular event space that hosts numerous conferences and exhibitions throughout the year. Historically part of Lancashire, Manchester Central lies within the historic county boundaries of Cheshire. Despite this, it remains an integral part of the city's infrastructure and a key gateway for visitors to Manchester."}
