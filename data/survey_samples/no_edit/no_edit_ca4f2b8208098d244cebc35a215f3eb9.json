It is situated in the Darling Scarp, a mountain range that runs along the eastern coast of the continent. Specifically, Anderson Heights is located in the administrative territorial entity of the Local Government Area of Stirling, approximately 10 kilometers south-east of the central business district of Perth. Despite its proximity to Mount Bennett, which rises to an elevation of 706 meters, Anderson Heights itself is relatively flat and low-lying. Nonetheless, it offers residents easy access to a range of amenities and services, including parks, schools, and shopping centers.", "coupled_prompt": "Mount Bennett is a mountain located on the continent of Antarctica, specifically in the section of the Transantarctic Mountains known as the Ellsworth Mountain Range. It is part of the administrative territorial entity of Marie Byrd Land and has a summit elevation of 3,501 meters (11,486 feet). While it does not have any direct relationship to Anderson Heights, which is a location in Alaska, USA, both mountains are impressive natural features that offer stunning views and valuable scientific insights into the geology and climate of their respective regions."}
