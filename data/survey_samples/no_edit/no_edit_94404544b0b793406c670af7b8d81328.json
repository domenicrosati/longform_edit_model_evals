He was born into a musical family, his father being an organist at San Marco, and he studied with his uncle, Giacomo Angelini. Marcello was known for his sacred music, particularly his masses and motets, but also composed secular cantatas and solo songs. He was married to Faustina Bembo and had three children. Marcello died of tuberculosis in 1739 in Venice.\nMarcello's music is characterized by its elegance and expressiveness, reflecting the polychoral style of Venetian church music. His works are part of the Baroque period and were influential on composers such as Handel and Bach. Despite his relatively short life, Marcello left a significant legacy in the world of classical music.\nSome interesting facts about Marcello include that he was fluent in several languages, including Latin, Italian, and German, and he was an accomplished organist and harpsichordist. He was also a student of the famous composer and organist, Baldassare Galuppi. Unfortunately, Marcello suffered from poor health throughout his life, which may have contributed to his early death at the age of 53.", "coupled_prompt": "Baldassare Galuppi (1706-1785) was an Italian Baroque composer and organist. He studied under Antonio Lotti and was known for his operas, oratorios, and sacred music. Galuppi worked primarily in the opera seria genre, which was popular during the Baroque period. He was a skilled organist and held positions at several churches in Venice, including San Geremia and San Maria Formosa. Although little is known about his personal life, Galuppi was believed to be male and was active in the musical scene in Venice throughout his lifetime. His works are housed in the Museo Internazionale dei Musici di Venezia, and he is also represented in the collections of the Biblioteca Nacional de Madrid and the British Library. Galuppi had a close relationship with fellow composer and mentor Benedetto Marcello, with whom he collaborated on several projects. Despite his talent and productivity, Galuppi's compositions did not gain widespread recognition until after his death, when they were rediscovered and reevaluated by later musicologists."}
