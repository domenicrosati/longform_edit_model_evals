Born in 1945 in Natchez, Mississippi, USA, Dara grew up in a musical family and was exposed to various genres from an early age. He adopted the stage name \"Olu\" after his Yoruba ancestors and \"Dara\" after his mother's maiden name. As a child, he was exposed to the blues by his father, who was a blues musician himself. Dara's music often explores themes of social justice, spirituality, and personal freedom. He has released several albums on various labels, including his debut album \"On Fathers' Day\" on Antilles Records. He is also known for his collaborations with other artists such as Don Cherry, Charlie Haden, and Billy Higgins.

He was born in Florence, Italy, but grew up in Boston, Massachusetts, where he studied art at the Museum School. Sargent was known for his portrait paintings, which were characterized by their attention to detail and vivid color. He was also skilled at capturing the likeness of his subjects, and his work is considered some of the best examples of realist painting. Throughout his career, Sargent traveled extensively throughout Europe, working in London, Paris, and Venice, among other cities. He was openly gay, despite the societal norms of his time, and his personal life was marked by several romantic relationships with men. Sargent died in 1925 in his flat in Paris, France, after suffering from heart failure.
